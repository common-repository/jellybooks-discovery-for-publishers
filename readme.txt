The Jellybooks DISCOVERY for Publishers plugin adds instant book samples to your book product pages.

=== Description ===

This is a plugin that simplifies the integration of the Jellybooks DISCOVERY service API, and embeds interactive book samples within product pages on a WordPress site: 

1. It connects to the Jellybooks DISCOVERY API to retrieve book samples for a given ISBN.
2. It automatically adds interactive book samples to your book product pages via our excerpts.js library.

Note: For the avoidance of doubt, admins must have a valid Jellybooks DISCOVERY account and API key to use this plugin.

For further information about the API: https://www.jellybooks.com/apis/excerpts/index.html
For further information about the excerpts.js library: https://www.jellybooks.com/apis/excerpt_integration/index.html. That page also explains some of the various options that are configurable in the plugin admin interface.

=== Source code ===

The plugin can be downloaded and its source code can be viewed and modified (as per Open Source license). The plugin also contains Jellybooks' [excerpts.js library](https://github.com/Jellybooks/excerpts-js) in a minified form for improved performance.

A non-minified version is included within the assets directory. The full source code for the excerpts.js JavaScript and CSS files can be found in the [`excerpts.js` repository](https://github.com/Jellybooks/excerpts-js).
